![Screenshot of Weather App]({6EEEF953-0768-4379-925E-2EE8B3D1FAFB}.png)

This is a simple weather application frontend built with Next.js and React.  
The app communicates with a custom weather API: [https://weather-app-backend-hkr2.onrender.com](https://weather-app-backend-hkr2.onrender.com)  
You can find the backend repository here: [weather-app-backend GitHub](https://github.com/Krzeselkoo/Weather-App-Backend) <!-- Change this link if your backend repo is elsewhere -->

## About

This project is a frontend for a weather application.  
It fetches weather data and weekly summaries from the backend API and displays them in a clear, responsive interface.  
To provide accurate weather information for your area, the app requires access to your current location (geolocation).

**Features:**
- Displays a 7-day weather forecast for your location
- Shows a weekly weather summary in the footer
- Dark mode toggle
- Error handling for API and geolocation issues

## Requirements

- The user must allow access to their location for the app to work correctly.
- The backend API must be running and accessible at [https://weather-app-backend-hkr2.onrender.com](https://weather-app-backend-hkr2.onrender.com).

## Roadmap

- Add an interactive map to select or view locations
- Implement cookies for saving user preferences (e.g., dark mode)
- Further UI/UX improvements
